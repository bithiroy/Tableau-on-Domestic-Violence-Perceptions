# Tableau-on-Domestic-Violence-Perceptions

This visualisation presents perceptions about domestic violence against women and girls using two datasets: (1) a survey covering perceptions about violence against women and girls conducted in African, Asian and South American countries, and (2) percentage of violence against women and girls by their intimate partners in that countries. 

First. the presentation shows a geographical distribution of people justifying violence, including top countries for domestic violence against women and girls by their age group. Second, the visualisation shows the distribution of people in different demographic categories justifying violence. Third and final, the presentation shows percentage of male and female justifying different reasons for violence. 

Overall, the presentation reveals that female justify violence against female more than male do. Lack of education appears to be an important reason for this justification.
